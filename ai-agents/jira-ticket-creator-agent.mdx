### How It Works

1. **Slack Direct Message Trigger:** The agent listens for messages in your Slack DMs.
2. **AI Validation:** The message is checked for:
   - User confirmation (e.g., "Please create this ticket")
   - Required ticket details (Project, Summary, Description, Issue Type)
3. **Valid Message:** If all details are present:
   - AI extracts structured ticket data.
   - A Jira ticket is created automatically.
   - A confirmation message is sent back to Slack.
4. **Incomplete Message:** If details are missing:
   - The agent sends a polite message in Slack asking for missing information and lists available Jira projects.
   - Provides an example format to help the user.

## Conclusion

The **Jira Ticket Creator Agent** automates ticket creation, saving time and eliminating manual entry. By integrating Slack, OpenAI, and Jira Cloud, it ensures only valid, well-structured requests become Jira tickets, streamlining team workflows.
