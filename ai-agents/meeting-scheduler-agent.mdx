description: "Automate responding to meeting requests by detecting intent in Gmail, analyzing your Google Calendar for availability, and drafting context-aware replies using OpenAI GPT models."
---

The **Meeting Scheduler Agent** scans your Gmail inbox for meeting-related requests, analyzes your Google Calendar for current availability, and drafts clear, polite responses—all powered by OpenAI’s GPT models. The agent saves these replies as Gmail drafts for your review, making scheduling seamless and professional.

---

## Overview

The **Meeting Scheduler Agent** enables you to:

- Monitor your Gmail inbox for both explicit and subtle requests to schedule meetings, appointments, or calls.
- Intelligently determine from each email if the sender is seeking your availability, using advanced language analysis.
- Retrieve all busy slots from your connected Google Calendar—never offering times that conflict with existing events.
- Suggest only 30-minute (or longer) windows during your working hours (09:00–17:00), unless the sender asks for weekends.
- Automatically draft a reply with 2–4 available slots, tailoring responses to the email’s tone and full thread history.
- Save the response as a Gmail draft so you stay in control of all outgoing scheduling replies.

This agent dramatically reduces manual effort and confusion in booking meetings, ensuring your responses are prompt, clear, and never double-booked.
